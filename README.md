# 🍎 Freshify - Fresh vs Rotten Fruit Classification using CNN

A deep learning-based image classification system that detects whether a fruit (apple, banana, or orange) is fresh or rotten using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project demonstrates the power of computer vision in agricultural and supply chain automation.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Goal:** Classify fruit images as *fresh* or *rotten* using a CNN model.
- **Dataset:** ~13,599 images from Kaggle (apples, bananas, oranges — fresh & rotten).
- **Approach:** Preprocess images → Augment data → Train CNN → Evaluate accuracy.

---

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Rotten vs Fresh Fruits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Categories:**  
  - Fresh Apple, Banana, Orange  
  - Rotten Apple, Banana, Orange  
- **Total Images:** 13,599  
  - **Training Set:** 10,901  
  - **Test Set:** 2,698  
- **Image Size:** Resized to 224x224 pixels

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Framework:** Sequential CNN model (custom-built)

---

## 🧼 Preprocessing Steps

- Image resizing  
- Normalization  
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom) to improve generalization  
- Label encoding for classification (Fresh = 0, Rotten = 1)

---

## 🧠 CNN Model Architecture

- **Conv2D + ReLU** layers for feature extraction  
- **MaxPooling2D** for spatial downsampling  
- **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting  
- **Fully connected (Dense) layers** for classification  
- **Sigmoid activation** in the output layer for binary classification

---

## 🎯 Results

| Metric     | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | 98.79%    |
| Loss       | 0.0337    |
| Model Type | Custom CNN |

- **Evaluation Tools:**  
  - Accuracy & loss plots  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## 📊 Sample Predictions

- ✅ Fresh Banana → Classified correctly  
- ❌ Rotten Orange → Misclassified as Fresh (example for error analysis)

## 📌 Conclusion

The model achieved **98.79% accuracy**, showing its robustness in classifying fresh and rotten fruits. It demonstrates the potential of CNNs in solving real-world agricultural quality control problems.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Deploy the model as a web or mobile app for real-time detection  
- Expand to more fruit types and include degree-of-ripeness classification  
- Use Transfer Learning for faster and potentially better results
